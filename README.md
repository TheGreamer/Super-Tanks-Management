This is a simple interface for configuring super tanks settings. There are no requirements to be in game while using the program. In order to use the program, you must subscribe this addon in steam (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2945298750) then create a local server in Left 4 Dead 2. Then join the game. Then go back to the main menu. This will create the configuration files of super tanks mod. At the first launch, you must select the path of "allowtanks.txt" file so the program will remember where your configuration files are every next time. You can change these settings better this way.
